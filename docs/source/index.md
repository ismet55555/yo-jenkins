`yojenkins` is a cross-platform command line interface (CLI) tool to monitor,
manage, and have fun with a Jenkins server. It makes it possible to interact
with a Jenkins server without using the browser based Jenkins UI.

This tool is able to be integrated into a script as middleware in
order to automate Jenkins related tasks or enable Jenkins configuration
as code.

**`yojenkins` will liberate you and your browser from the Jenkins Web UI**
