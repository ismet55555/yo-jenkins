## Deployment

- Fix  reference to `yo_jenkins/server_docker_settings`
    - How to get the reference
    - Checkout --sample option on exam-terminal?
    - Directories missing:
        - `server_docker_settings`
        - `sound`

- Cannot install on WSL
    Collecting yo-jenkins
    Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement yo-jenkins (from versions: )
    No matching distribution found for yo-jenkins

- Cannot install from testPYPI
    - Dependency issue
    - Can it be that something went bad from 0.0.1 to 0.0.2???


--------------------------------------------------


When starting a monitor, don't instantly play sound
at no status change!


--------------------------------------------------


Derived full folder path: folderFullName
in Job() object cuts off one too many directories


--------------------------------------------------


Build monitor SOMETIMES does not update
    - Maybe threads fail?
    - Restart if they fail?
    - Heart beat on the threads


--------------------------------------------------
